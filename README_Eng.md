# Reliable-UDP-transport-protocol
   Based on the connection-oriented, reliable and byte throttle-based UDP transmission layer communication protocol, it abandons the redundant function of TCP when rapidly transmitting short data packets, and achieves better results than TCP communication, and is superior to TCP in terms of real-time data, transmission efficiency and bandwidth utilization.
